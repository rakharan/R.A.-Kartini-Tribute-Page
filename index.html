                <h3 id="headline">Facts about Kartini:</h3>
                <li>She was born in Jepara, Central Java, on 21st April 1879</li>
                <li>Born into an aristocratic Javanese family in the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia, she attended a
                    Dutch language primary school.</li>
                <li>After she turned 12 she was secluded (<em>pingit</em>) at home, a common practice among Javanese
                    nobility, to prepare young girls for their marriage. During her seclusion, Kartini continued to
                    educate herself on her own.</li>
                <li>Because she could speak Dutch, she acquired several Dutch pen friends. One of them, a girl by the
                    name of Rosa Abendanon, became a close friend.</li>
                <li>Kartini's parents arranged her marriage to Joyodiningrat, the Regency Chief of Rembang, who already
                    had three wives. She was married on 12 November 1903.</li>
                <li>Her husband understood Kartini's aims and allowed her to establish a school for women in the east
                    porch of the Rembang Regency Office complex.</li>
                <li>Kartini's only son was born on 13 September 1904. A few days later on 17 September 1904, Kartini
                    died at the age of 25. She was buried in Bulu Village, Rembang.</li>
                <li>After Raden Ajeng Kartini died, Mr. J. H. Abendanon, the Minister for Culture, Religion and
                    Industry in the East Indies, collected and published the letters that Kartini had sent to her
                    friends in Europe. The book was titled <em><strong>Door Duisternis tot Licht</em></strong> (Out of
                    Dark Comes Light) and was published in 1911.</li>
